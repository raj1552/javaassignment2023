You are required to create a simple billing system to take customer orders for a local
handicraft store in Patan. The store is a start-up and offers limited products. We take 10
products for the sake of this system. You are required to create a prototype of billing
system to ease the working process within the store. Your approach to solution needs
to be object oriented. Your programming solution should create and implement
suitable classes and objects. Programming solution with only main class will not
qualify to become a submission for this task. Your program should have the following
functionalities:


• The program should display the list of items on sale at the start (with 10
products)

• Each customer will make an order based on the menu shown. For each order,
the system should calculate the total bill.

• For each sale, 12% of the sold money goes to local charity. For each purchase
made by the customer, your system should show the amount that goes for the
charity, the amount that goes to the store and the total payment that the
customer needs to make.

• For every new instance where a customer (new or repeating) makes an order, a
new bill is generated.

• Altering a confirmed order would not be a necessary feature for the MVP phase
of the system.

• Your MVP should be able to manage order and billing of 5 customers at once.
The system should prompt (ask) to repeat after each billing.

• The menu prices and the dishes in them could be initially hardwired into your
MVP for test purposes (in a file or an array)
